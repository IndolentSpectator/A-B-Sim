# **A/B Testing: Data Simulation and Interpretation**
## **1. Project Overview**
A/B testing is a common statistical method used to determine whether a change in a system (such as a website or an application) leads to a significant improvement in key performance indicators. This project **simulates an A/B test** to evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental change in increasing user engagement (click rate).

### **Objective**
- Simulate user click behavior for two groups: **Control** and **Experimental**.
- Conduct hypothesis testing to assess whether the observed difference in click rates is statistically significant.
- Interpret the results to decide if the experimental version leads to a meaningful improvement.

## **2. Data Simulation Process**
### **Step 1: Define Parameters**
- **Number of Users:**
  - **Control Group**: 10,000 users
  - **Experimental Group**: 10,000 users
- **Click Probability:**
  - **Control Group**: 20% (p = 0.2)
  - **Experimental Group**: 40% (p = 0.4)

### **Step 2: Generate Click Data**
- Click behavior is simulated using a **binomial distribution**:
  \[
  X \sim \text{Binomial}(n=1, p)
  \]
  - A value of **1** represents a user clicking on the interface.
  - A value of **0** represents no click.

  

## **3. Statistical Analysis**
### **Step 3: Compute Click Rates**
- **Observed Click Rates**:
 

- The expected difference in click rates:
  \[
  \Delta p = p_{exp} - p_{con}
  \]

### **Step 4: Conduct Hypothesis Testing**
#### **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**
- There is **no difference** between the control and experimental groups:
  \[
  H_0: p_{exp} = p_{con}
  \]

#### **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**
- The experimental group has a significantly higher click rate:
  \[
  H_1: p_{exp} > p_{con}
  \]

#### **Step 5: Calculate the Z-Score**
The test statistic is computed using the standard error:

\[
SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_{pooled} (1 - p_{pooled})}{N_{exp}} + \frac{p_{pooled} (1 - p_{pooled})}{N_{con}}}
\]

where:
\[
p_{pooled} = \frac{\text{Total Clicks in both groups}}{\text{Total Users in both groups}}
\]

\[
Z = \frac{p_{exp} - p_{con}}{SE}
\]

## **4. Interpretation of Results**
- If **p-value < 0.05**, we reject the **null hypothesis** and conclude that the experimental change **significantly increased clicks**.
- If **p-value ≥ 0.05**, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis, meaning there's **no sufficient evidence** to claim an improvement.

Possible Outcomes:
1. **Statistically Significant Result (p < 0.05):**
   - The experimental change positively impacted user engagement.
   - The company should implement the new version.
   
2. **Non-Significant Result (p ≥ 0.05):**
   - The observed difference could be due to chance.
   - No evidence to justify implementing the change.

## **5. Conclusion**
This project **simulated an A/B test** and applied statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate an experimental change's impact. The approach demonstrates:
- How data can be generated to **mimic real-world user interactions**.
- How statistical inference techniques **validate business decisions**.
- The importance of **p-values and hypothesis testing** in experimental design.
